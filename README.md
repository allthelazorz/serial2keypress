# serial2keypress

I have thrown together this small program to be able to use the excellent Morserino keyer as a keyboard on my PC.

The code is ugly, could be improved in lot of ways, I will probably do some fixes on it in the near future.

The Morserino outputs the keyed characters on its USB-serial port, this program converts it to Windows keypresses, so you can type into any other window as long as the program is running.

I have built the code in Visual Studio as a C++ Console App. I have uploaded the current build if you don't have it installed. I swear I haven't put any malicious thing into it, but it is generally not wise to trust a random executable you find on the Internet.
